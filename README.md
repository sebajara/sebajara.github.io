Personal website for blog and portafolio. Originally generated using
[dataoptimal.github.io](https://github.com/dataoptimal/dataoptimal.github.io)
as template (See repo's README is great for information). With time I am
adding a few minor edits, mostly on the style-sheet for appearance.

## Resources I found useful

* How to see your site locally? [github's explanation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll). Before I was committing while testing! Note: don't install jekyll using apt-get, use bundler instead [see this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57105493/error-uninitialized-constant-ffiplatformcpu-on-starting-jekyll-server).
* [MathJax quick reference](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference)

## TODO
- On posts layout, add snapshot of the header image.
- On posts layout, add toc?
